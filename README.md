# Specific_language_impairment_detection

## Introduction
specific language impairment (SLI), is a language disorder that delays the language development in children who have no hearing problems, neurological dysfunctions or other developmental delays. Detecting SLI at an early stage is very important for successful speech therapy in children. At present, there exists only one publicly available SLI database (link) . This database was launched at LANNA (Laboratory of Artificial Neural Network Applications) in the Czech Technical University in Prague and has been available since 2016. 

|      -       | All          | Healthy      | Patient      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Girls        | 48           | 29           | 19           |
| Boys         | 50           | 15           | 35           |
| All Children | 98           | 44           | 54           |


## Method
The proposed system for automatic detection of SLI from speech is shown below.
